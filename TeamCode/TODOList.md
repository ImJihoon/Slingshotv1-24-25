# TODO List for Mechanisms & Code

## KEY: 
- Q = Quick to Finish
- IP = In Progress
- B = Bread's got it
- L = Long to Finish
- R = Needs Refactoring
- U = Uncertain -> Needs Clarification
- H = Waiting on Hardware
- *_* = HIGH PRIORITY
- T = Code Written, Needs Testing
- J = Jam's got it

## TO DO
1) Add auton actions - Q, J
2) Update all the buttons - B
3) Specimen Claw - U, B (LM2)

# Small Hardware Jobs

# Testing (Writing Test Class)
1) New Extendo Controls - T
2) *Analog Pivot (see above), write new test class* - T (set servo to CR mode, use setPos but with the power value from the encoder)
3) FSM - T
4) Slow Mode - T
5) Check repeatability on slides - T
   1) repeatability is after moving it away and setting target BACK to its original target, not checking if its accurate, but does it go back to the same place it was last time

# LATER Code (for optimization/awards)
1) Cohen Coon Method/Equation with Adaptice PID
