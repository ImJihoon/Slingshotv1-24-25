# TODO List for Mechanisms & Code

## KEY: 
- Q = Quick to Finish
- IP = In Progress
- B = Bread's got it
- L = Long to Finish
- R = Needs Refactoring
- U = Uncertain -> Needs Clarification
- H = Waiting on Hardware
- *_* = HIGH PRIORITY
- T = Code Written, Needs Testing

## TO DO
1) *Tune Outtake Slide PID - B, T*
3) *Update everything in FSM - B, L*
4) *Add auton actions - Q*
5) Specimen Claw - U, B (LM2)

# Small Hardware Jobs

# Testing (Writing Test Class)
1) New Extendo Controls, T
2) Analog Pivot (see above), T
3) *Small Testing Classes for FSM*
4) *Bucket Servo*, T
